    <p>This Lunar New Year day is a time of enjoyment and a time of clean start.
      There are crowds of people waiting for the beginning of the parade.
      Many people walk to find a spot to stay when the parade starts.
      Voices of families and friends can be heard throughout the crowds of people.
      The cold air fills the sky as the parade starts.
      There are voices that can be heard very far along the streets.
      The voices that are filled with excitement.
      You can see people walking from the street.
      There are lions moving from place to place shimmering with the glow of the gold.
      The people inside the lion dance to the noises of the sounds.
      There are dragons moving from swaying from side to side.
      The movement of the people under the dragon moving it.
      The dragons have different colors that represent quite different styles.
      The presents of the lions fill the air with luck.
      Many colors are seen from minute to minute.
      There is a sudden explosion of different colors flooding the streets.
      They are confetti cannon letting out hundreds of streams of paper bits that colorfully litter the streets. </p>

    <p>The parade has many things like lions, dragons and cars.
      The people that are on the streets are those who are in the parade.
      There can be stuff like gloves to snacks that the people give.
      Many people stay till the end of the parade, while others leave for other means.
      While the parade was going there were lions outside going from building to building.
      The parades were a normal thing for my family.
      It was quite cold that day.
      But the parade was fun to watch.
      The dragons swaying back and forth showed a lot of detail.
      The dance itself was cool in which it was a one time thing that happens each year.
      The lion dance was unique in that there was a lot of detail on the dragons and lions.
      The many colors that were present in the parade.
      That can represent many things.
      Such as the people and the city.
      The many cultures spread throughout New York.
      Mott street is usually gray and dull, but that day it was filled with bold reds and shimmering golds.</p>
    <p>The clearance of the parade changed the streets that day.
      New York can be many different colors from a bright color to many dark colors.
      New York City is like a world that hasnâ€™t been seen by its fullest extent.
      But there will always be a New York with a bright sky and good weather.
      People at times are quite busy just like the many people in chinatown.
      New York is anyways at times crowded with people rushing and getting to somewhere fast.
      Unlike in the Lunar New Year parade, the people are in crowded groups to enjoy the beginning of a fresh start.
      New York can be overwhelming at the start but the small things can be huge.
      Since there can be lots of things to learn from the experience being there.
      This is New York City.
      A New York City was once,
      This place was once called New Amsterdam.
      But now its called New York.
      The place is better and well known.
      The Lunar New Year is a parade is
      small in size but big impact.</p>
